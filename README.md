# Recipe Hub
We created an application that allows users to type in ingredients so that they can find a simple recipe for breakfast, lunch or dinner. There is also a random joke of the day included on our application to provide the user with a good laugh. The live link to our application can be found [here](https://dbreznay.github.io/Recipe-Hub/.)
